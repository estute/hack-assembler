# hack-assembler
my attempt at writing the Hack assembler from Elements of Computer Systems

The chapter 6 project in the ECS book is to develop an Assembler for
the Hack computer platform. It can be written in the language of your
choice, but must implement a strict API. I have chosen to do this in
Python.
